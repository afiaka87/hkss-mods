# Trail Visibility Fix Summary

## The Problems

1. **Broken Harmony Patch Structure**: The `OnHeroStart` method in TrailPatches had a malformed closing brace on line 121 - just `}` instead of properly indented `        }`. This broke the entire patch structure.

2. **Wrong Initialization Order**: The code was waiting for HeroController.Start to create the trail object, but the patch wasn't working due to the malformed structure. Even if it worked, this was the wrong approach.

3. **Circular Dependency**:
   - OnHeroStart was supposed to call CreateTrailObject()
   - CreateTrailObject creates BreadcrumbTrail component
   - BreadcrumbTrail.Start() creates MultiSceneTrailManager
   - But OnHeroStart was never being called!

## The Solution

1. **Immediate Creation**: Like the working InputTimeline mod, we now create the trail GameObject immediately in BreadcrumbPlugin.Awake(), not waiting for HeroController.

2. **Fixed Method Structure**: Removed the broken OnHeroStart patch entirely since we don't need it anymore.

3. **Changed BreadcrumbTrail initialization**: Moved MultiSceneTrailManager creation from Start() to Awake() for immediate initialization.

## Key Lessons

- **Always create UI/display GameObjects immediately in Awake()** - don't wait for game objects like HeroController
- **Check brace matching carefully** - a single malformed brace can break entire Harmony patches
- **Follow working examples** - InputTimeline showed the correct pattern
- **Test incrementally** - this regression could have been caught immediately if tested after refactoring

## Testing Checklist

When you test the mod now, you should see in the logs:
1. "Breadcrumb Trail v1.0.0 loaded!"
2. "Creating breadcrumb trail system..."
3. "BreadcrumbTrail Awake"
4. "Creating new MultiSceneTrailManager"
5. "[MultiSceneTrailManager] Initialized"

And you should see:
- Visible trail lines following your movement
- Trails persisting across room transitions
- Trail data saved to `BepInEx/plugins/TrailSaves/trail_data.json`
